Interface workflow.

Interface Effect

Interface Component -> Components come with their own coords.
--> Button
--> Label

Interface Controller -> Sends mouse events and keyboard events to the Interface Model.

Interface Model -> Keeps a pointer to the current menu, as well as handling information consumed by the interfaces (ie, keeps track of item count).

Menus -> Keep a list of components. Consume mouse and keyboard events and modify their components accordingly.
